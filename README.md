This repo contains the coursework I am working on for the free online course Autumn 2018 taught by Andrew Ng.

The goal is to collect all useful information (from offerings in diferent years in one place), track my progress, and to help others.

You are free to download my notes and homework solutions, although accredition (e.g. cloning or forking this repo) is appreciated. ugly handwriting, but hope the contents is rigorous. If you find any errors, I'd appreciate you let me know.
